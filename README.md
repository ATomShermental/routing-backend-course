# Routing Backend Course
## Description
This course is intended for learning Java, Spring framework, algorithms and data structures, some optimization methods and OSM system. You will develop the [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of routing backend.
### Features of the backend
- Map fragment view (get data about map fragment);
- Finding optimal route from point to point;
- Authentication (signing in, signing up, password restoration, email verification);

- CRUD of saved places;
- account deletion.
## Course Interaction
1. Fork this repository.
2. The course is divided into modules (you can find information about every module in the corresponding folder). Each module is divided into lessons. You should create a branch for a module, then commit implementations of this module's lessons to this branch.
3. After completion of the module, you must create a pull request from module's branch to 'main' branch and add me (@stefjen07) or your mentor as a reviewer. You may be requested for some changes in your source code.
4. If your reviewer approves the pull request, you can merge it (use [squash and merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html)) and go to the next module.
## Modules
### Module 1. OSM data preparation
### Module 2. Authentication
