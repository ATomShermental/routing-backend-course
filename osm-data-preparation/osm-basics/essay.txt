The OSM is like a wiki for the map of our world, that is created by a community of people just for free. It represents 
all the objects on the map, that we need to navigate the map.

The main OSM elements are: nodes, ways and relations.

The first one is node. It is basic element in OSM of our map representation. It is refers to the points on the map,
such bus stops, traffic light or building entrance. Also it may have tags with special features of it, such as
it's latitude and longitude coordinates, description and the others.

The second one is way. It is a sequence of nodes on the map, that represents roads or other paths. It also may have
tags with special features of it, such as width, speedlimit, type of surface and the others.

The last one is relation. Relations is a sequnce of nodes and ways to represent more complex object on the map, such as
bus way with all the stops and roads. It also may have special tags, that can be a combination of tags, that are refers
to the nodes and ways relevant to this relation.

OSM have a lot of file formats, but the main are two: PBF and XML.

XML is a human-readable file format that can be parsed with relevant libraries. But it has it's own disadvantages,
such as a large file size and they are slower to parse.

PBF is a binary file format that is more complex than XML but is it has smaller file size and this file format
can be parsed x10 faster then XML.

So both file types has their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one to choose depends on your needs 
and data size that you will work with.
