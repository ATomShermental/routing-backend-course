[OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) (OSM) is a collaborative project that aims to create a free, editable map of the world. Unlike traditional mapping services that are created and maintained by large corporations, OSM is crowdsourced, meaning that anyone can contribute to the map by adding, modifying, or deleting features. OSM is often considered the Wikipedia of maps, as it follows a similar model of user-generated content. The data collected by OSM is stored in a structured format that can be downloaded and used for various purposes, including routing applications. In this lesson, we will explore the basics of OSM, including the different types of OSM elements, the main file formats used to store OSM data, and the OSM data model.<br>
The OSM data model is a way of representing real-world features, such as roads, buildings, and points of interest, in a structured format that can be used for mapping and other geospatial applications. The OSM data model consists of three main types of elements: [nodes, ways, and relations](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements).<br>
Nodes are the most basic element in the OSM data model and represent individual points on the map, such as the location of a traffic light or a building entrance. Nodes are defined by their latitude and longitude coordinates and can be tagged with various attributes to describe their features.<br>
Ways are a sequence of nodes that represent linear features on the map, such as roads, footpaths, or waterways. Ways are defined by a series of connected nodes and can be tagged with various attributes to describe their features, such as their surface type, width, or speed limit.<br>
Relations are used to define more complex features that cannot be represented by a single node or way. For example, a relation could be used to represent a bus route, which consists of multiple ways and stops. Relations are defined by a set of member elements and can be tagged with various attributes to describe their features.<br>
In addition to these elements, the OSM data model also includes a tagging system that allows users to describe the features of nodes, ways, and relations. Tags are key-value pairs that can be added to OSM elements to provide additional information about their features. For example, a road way may be tagged with attributes such as its name, surface type, number of lanes, and speed limit.<br>
OpenStreetMap data can be downloaded and stored in different [file formats](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_file_formats), each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The two main file formats used to store OSM data are [XML](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML) and [Protocolbuffer Binary Format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) (PBF).<br>
XML is a text-based file format that is human-readable and can be easily processed using standard tools and libraries. XML files can be compressed to reduce their size, but they are still relatively large compared to other file formats. XML files are also slower to parse and load than other file formats, which can be a disadvantage when working with large datasets.<br>
PBF, on the other hand, is a binary file format that is more compact and efficient than XML. PBF files can be up to 10 times smaller than their equivalent XML files, which makes them ideal for storing and processing large datasets. PBF files are also faster to parse and load than XML, which makes them a popular choice for applications that need to process OSM data in real-time.<br>
Overall, the choice of file format depends on the specific use case and the available tools and resources. XML is a more accessible and human-readable format, but it may not be suitable for large datasets or real-time processing. PBF is a more compact and efficient format, but it may require specialized tools and libraries to work with.<br>
