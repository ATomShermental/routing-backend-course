# Lesson 2. Downloading OSM data

To work with OpenStreetMap data, the first step is to download the data in a format that can be used by your application. In this lesson, we will explore the different ways to download OSM data, including using the OSM website and third-party data providers.

## Downloading Data from the OSM Website

The easiest way to download OSM data is to use the export feature on the OSM website. The export feature allows you to download a customized portion of the OSM map in either XML or PBF format. To use the export feature, simply navigate to the OSM website, zoom in to the area of the map that you are interested in, and select the export button. You can then choose the file format and customize the download area by drawing a bounding box or selecting a pre-defined area. The main disadvantage of this method is that you can only select a small area for downloading.

## Downloading Data from Third-Party Data Providers

There are many third-party data providers that offer pre-processed OSM data in various formats. These data providers often offer additional features, such as regular updates, data cleaning, and data enrichment. Some popular third-party data providers include Protomaps, Mapzen, Geofabrik, and Planet OSM.

## Task

We will use [Protomaps](https://app.protomaps.com/downloads/osm) to download the OSM data. Go to the link above, select your desired area and click 'Create Extract'. Wait for the completion of this task. After that you will be able to download extracted data in PFB format. The file with extracted data will be very large to upload it on GitHub. You can upload it somewhere else and commit the link or upload the screenshots with the downloading progress.
